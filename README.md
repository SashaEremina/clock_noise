All figures are plotted in MATLAB 2020 or later. Image processing toolbox, Signal processing toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox, and Curve fitting toolbox need to be installed.
Please, download the data and simulations for plotting from this github directory and put the folder into your MATLAB directory. Keep the code from this git_hub page in the code subfolder and run figure by figure.
